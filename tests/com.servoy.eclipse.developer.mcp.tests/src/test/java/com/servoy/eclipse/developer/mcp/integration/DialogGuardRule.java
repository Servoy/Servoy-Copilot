 * <pre>
 *   {@literal @}Rule
 *   public DialogGuardRule dialogGuard = new DialogGuardRule();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <b>Before each test:</b> activates the {@link TestDialogInterceptor} SWT display filter
 * and clears any leftover state from the previous test.
 * <p>
 * <b>After each test:</b> drains pending SWT {@code asyncExec} callbacks (so dialogs
 * opened in the last moments of the test are processed), then fails the test if any
 * unexpected dialog was detected. The failure message includes the dialog title,
 * the label text found inside the shell, and the UI-thread stack trace captured
 * at the moment the shell became visible — making it easy to identify exactly which
 * production-code callsite opened the dialog.
 * <p>
 * Tests that intentionally trigger a dialog must push a {@link DialogExpectation}
 * via {@link TestDialogInterceptor#expect(DialogExpectation)} <em>before</em> the call
 * that causes the dialog to appear.
